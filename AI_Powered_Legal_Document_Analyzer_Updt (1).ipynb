Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three.

This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\\n\\n2.

Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\\n\\n         2.2      Shipment.

In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.

The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\\n\\n                                    Page -4-\\n\\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\\n\\n         2.3      Delivery.

Definitions   Adverse experience: Any adverse event associated with the use of a biological or drug product in humans, whether or not considered product related, including the following: an adverse event occurring in the course of the use of a biological or drug product in professional practice; an adverse event occurring from overdose of the product whether accidental or intentional; an adverse event occurring from abuse of the product; an adverse event occurring from withdrawal of the product; and any failure of expected pharmacological action.   Disability: A substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions.   Life-threatening adverse experience: Any adverse experience that places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred, i.e., it does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.   Labeled event: An adverse experience that is listed on the product insert as having been observed in patients who are receiving the drug product.\\n\\n{***} Confidential portions of this exhibit have been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a confidential treatment request in accordance with Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.   Page 18 of 28\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Drug Product: A finished dosage form, for example, tablet, capsule, or solution that contains an active ingredient generally, but not necessarily, in association with inactive ingredients   Serious adverse experience: Any adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse experience, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   Unexpected adverse experience: Any adverse experience that is not listed in the current labelling for the biological or drug product. This includes events that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labelling, but differ from the event because of greater severity or specificity.   For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the labeling only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the labeling only listed cerebral vascular accidents. \\\"Unexpected,\\\" as used in this definition, refers to an adverse experience that has not been previously observed (i.e., included in the labeling) rather than from the perspective of such experience not being anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical product.   Call report: A list of all questions, requests for circulars, and physician/patient complaints received by SCIEN's Clinical Support Department is prepared monthly by SCIEN staff and is forwarded to HEMISPHERX RA/QA Department.   Audit: A systematic examination of processes, controls and systems, operating procedures, reports, records and/or data to assess SCIEN's compliance with standards, regulatory submissions, SOPs; applicable laws, regulations, directives, standards and guidelines; the terms of this Agreement and other contracts in place defining the services being provided and to verify data integrity.   Good Clinical Practices (\\\"GCPs\\\"): Good clinical practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting trials that involve the participation of human subjects. Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and wellbeing of trial subjects are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical trial data are credible. ICH Guidance for Industry: E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance.   Good Manufacturing Practices (\\\"GMPs\\\"): The recognized pharmaceutical regulations and requirements of regulatory authorities such as those defined by the U.S. FDA's regulations at 21CFR Parts 210 and 211.   Key Contacts: Persons at SCIEN and HEMISPHERX assigned to assure proper communication and follow-up in a timely manner within both parties' organizations. Names, titles and full contact information for Key Contacts shall be appended to this Agreement as Attachment 1 and should be maintained up-to-date during the course of the project.   Observation: A statement of fact made during an audit that is substantiated by objective evidence. HEMISPHERX categorizes observations as follows:   o Critical: May pose risk to patient or consumer or otherwise compromise the integrity or quality of the material, product, process, or service being provided. Other instances that could be defined as a critical observation include: A practice that poses an immediate safety risk to personnel; Quality System(s) missing or not in compliance with regulations, guidelines, or corporate policies.\\n\\n{***} Confidential portions of this exhibit have been redacted and filed separately with the Commission pursuant to a confidential treatment request in accordance with Rule 24b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.   Page 19 of 28\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  o Major: Does not fully comply with regulations, guidelines or corporate policies and may pose unnecessary risks to the integrity or quality of material, product, process or service being provided. Other instances that could be defined as a major observation include: Likely or probable safety risk to personnel; Quality System(s) weak or needing improvement; repeated Minor deficiencies of a similar nature that indicate a systemic problem and therefore may be classified as Major. o Minor: Does not comply with regulations, guidelines, or corporate policies but does not directly impact the integrity or quality of the material, product, process, or service being provided. o Comment: Compliant with regulations, guidelines and/or corporate policies; however, the auditor comment serves as a recommendation relative to maintaining or improving a specific condition noted.   Out-of-Specification / Out-of-Trend (\\\"OOS / \\\"OOT\\\"): A result that is not within the established specifications or trend, whether these are qualitative or quantitative.   Standard Operating Procedures (\\\"SOPs\\\"): Procedures in effect at SCIEN that define the processes and controls by and under which activities are to be conducted to assure compliance with the appropriate Code of Federal Regulations.   7. Communications   To assure proper communication, notification and follow-up in a timely manner by both parties, \\\"Key\\\" contacts are listed in Attachment 1 of this Agreement. Key contacts shall have access to project managers and technical staff and, upon reasonable notice and as required, facilitate resolution of any issues. Every effort will be made by SCIEN to accommodate timely communications, including face-to-face meetings, with HEMISPHERX.   8.

This Agreement is not meant to supersede or replace controlled documents typically used to define and record the work to be conducted by SCIEN for HEMISPHERX. Specific requirements of this Agreement and/or any service contracts shall be articulated within SCIEN's current operating procedures and documentation systems.   9.

A Party believing that it is entitled to indemnification under Section 12.1.1 or 12.1.2 (an \\\"Indemnified Party\\\") will give prompt written notice (each, an \\\"Indemnification Claim Notice\\\") to the other Party (the \\\"Indemnifying Party\\\") upon receipt of notice of the commencement of any Claim for which indemnification may be sought, or if earlier, upon the assertion of any such Claim by a Third Party (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure by an Indemnified Party to give notice of a Claim of a Third Party as provided in this Section 12.2.1 will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligation under this Agreement except and only to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure to give notice). Each Indemnification Claim Notice will contain a description of the Claim and the nature and amount of the Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss are known at such time). The Indemnified Party will furnish promptly to the Indemnifying Party copies of all papers and official documents received in respect of any Losses. 12.2.2 Control of Defense. At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Claim by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within  after the Indemnifying Party's receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice. The assumption of the defense of a Claim by the Indemnifying Party will not be construed as an acknowledgment that the Indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of the Claim, nor will it constitute a waiver by the Indemnifying Party of any defenses it may assert against the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a Claim, the Indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of the Claim any legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party that is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Claim, the Indemnified Party will promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party all original notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party in connection with the Claim. Should the Indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of such Claim. 12.2.3 Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 12.2.2, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to (a) participate in, but not control, the defense of such Claim and to engage counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that such engagement will be at the Indemnified Party's own expense unless the engagement thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, and (b) control its defense of such Claim and to engage counsel of its choice for such purpose, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, if the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and engage counsel in accordance with Section 12.2.2. 12.2.4 Settlement. With respect to any Losses related solely to payment of money damages in connection with a Claim and that includes a complete and unconditional Source: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3302020 release of the Indemnified Party, will not result in the Indemnified Party admitting liability, becoming subject to injunctive or other equitable relief that will otherwise adversely affect the business of the Indemnified Party in any manner, and as to which the Indemnifying Party will have acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the Indemnifying Party will have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such terms as the Indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, will deem appropriate. With respect to all other Losses in connection with Claims, where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Claim in accordance with Section 12.2.2, the Indemnifying Party will have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss provided it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a Loss by the Indemnified Party that is reached without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Claim, the Indemnified Party will not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 12.2.5 Cooperation. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Claim, the Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and will furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation will include access during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Claim, and making employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, and the Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith. 12.3 Insurance. 12.3.1 Generally.

Source: PHASEBIO PHARMACEUTICALS INC, 10-K, 3302020 Each Party will provide the other Party a minimum of  prior written notice if it is unable to obtain appropriate insurance coverage or if its coverage is canceled, unable to be renewed or materially changed. For clarity, any insurance coverage or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage does not limit or reduce a Party's liability under this Agreement. Each Party will ensure that no subcontractor, including any Permitted Third Party, will continue to perform the work unless such subcontractor is insured as deemed appropriate by the Party engaging the Permitted Third Party. 12.3.2 Minimum Requirements. Commencing as of the start of the Clinical Trials and thereafter, during the Term (or longer if otherwise stated below), at a minimum, each Party will maintain the following types of insurance coverage at a minimum level that is the greater of (a) the highest minimum level required by Applicable Law in the countries in which the Clinical Trials and other obligations hereunder are being performed or (b) the following (to the extent different). 12.3.2.1 Commercial General Liability:  dollars ($) per occurrence;  dollars ($) Product and Completed Operations aggregate, including Premises & Operations, Personal Injury, Product and Completed Operations;  dollars ($) combined single limit on all owned, non-owned and hired vehicles of such Party. 12.3.2.2 Umbrella Excess Liability:  dollars ($) per occurrence. 12.3.2.3 Clinical Trials Liability:  dollars ($) per occurrence.

Biocept shall have the right to bring and control any action or proceeding with respect to any such infringement at its own expense and by counsel of its own choice. If Biocept elects not to bring any such action or proceeding with respect to such infringement, it shall promptly notify Life Technologies of the same and agrees to consider, in good faith a request by Life Technologies to bring any such action or proceeding. Any agreement allowing Life Technologies to bring such action or proceeding on behalf of Biocept shall be set forth in a separate written agreement between the parties. Except as expressly provided above, the parties shall be under no obligation to enforce any of their Intellectual Property Rights against any actual or threatened Third Party infringements. 15 8.2 Biocept Technology. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Biocept owns, and Life Technologies acknowledges Biocept's ownership of, (i) the Assay and the Selector technology, and (ii) all Intellectual Property Rights in the Assay and the Selector technology, and Life Technologies agrees that it shall not do or suffer to be done any act or thing or undertake any action anywhere that in any manner might infringe, or impair the validity, scope, or title of Biocept in the Assay, the Selector technology or Intellectual Property Rights owned by Biocept. Nothing herein shall limit Life Technologies' ability to prosecute fully any and all Intellectual Property Rights owned by Life Technologies with any patent office or related government agency or to respond fully to any government agency inquiry with respect to its Intellectual Property Rights, products, and services. 8.3 New Technology. In the course of the activities conducted by the parties, Biocept andor Life Technologies may conceive of inventions or discoveries or create works that constitute intellectual property and may be patentable or registerable as a copyright or other intellectual property right (all of the foregoing, including such intellectual property rights therein, collectively, \\\"Developments\\\"). Inventorship of all inventions and discoveries, whether or not patentable, will be determined in accordance with United States patent laws. Authorship of all copyrightable works will be determined in accordance with United States copyright laws. Subject to Section 8.2, as between the parties, Developments will be owned consistent with such determination of inventorship or authorship. To the extent any Development owned by Life Technologies relates directly to the practice of, or constitutes an improvement to, the Assay, Life Technologies hereby grants to Biocept, during the Term of this Agreement, and, except in the case of termination of this Agreement by Life Technologies for Biocept's uncured material breach, after expiration or termination of this Agreement, a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid license, including the right to sublicense, under Life Technologies' Intellectual Property Rights in such Developments, solely to develop, make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale, import, perform and provide the Assay. To the extent any Development owned by Biocept relates directly to the practice of, or constitutes an improvement to, the Assay, Biocept hereby grants to Life Technologies, during the Term of this Agreement, a non-exclusive license under Biocept's Intellectual Property Rights in such Development, solely to promote the Assay in the Territory and to perform the Professional Component of the Assay sold by the parties in the Territory, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 8.4 Technology Licenses. To the extent that any Third Party Intellectual Property Rights related to the capture and detection of CTCs must be licensed to perform the Assay, such royalty shall be paid by Biocept. To the extent that either party owns Intellectual Property Rights to specific biomarkers, targets, kits, dyes or technology utilized in the Assay other than for the capture and detection of CTCs, it will, to the extent it is able, grant during the Term of the Agreement, a non-exclusive license to the other party to practice these Intellectual Property Rights for the Assay. To the extent that either party has licensed or will license Intellectual Property Rights from Third Parties related to specific biomarkers, targets, kits, dyes or technology utilized in the Assay other than for the capture and detection of CTCs, it will, to the extent it is able, grant, during the Term of the Agreement, a non-exclusive license to the other party, or ensure that the 16 other party is covered under its license, to practice these Intellectual Property Rights for the Assay. In the event of the foregoing, then, subject to Section 8.5, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith an allocation of expenses for such Third Party licenses directly associated with the Assay. 8.5 Infringement. If any Third Party claims or brings an action alleging that performance of the Assay or Test by Biocept or Life Technologies or their Affiliates under this Agreement infringe (directly or indirectly) any of such Third Party's patent rights, Biocept shall use commercially reasonable efforts to address such claims. If Biocept determines to seek a license or otherwise obtain the right to use such Third Party intellectual property rights on behalf of Biocept and Life Technologies, then (i) if the Third Party intellectual property rights relate to the capture and detection of CTCs or the Phase I Assay analytes, then Biocept shall bear the costs of such licenses, including the payment of licensing fees, royalties or other payments, or (ii) if the Third Party intellectual property rights relate to specific biomarkers, targets, kits, dyes or technologies for the Phase II Assay, then the parties agree to negotiate in good faith an allocation of costs for such licenses, including payment of licensing fees, royalties or other payments that may be due to such Third Party, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. If Biocept and Life Technologies determine to seek a license or otherwise obtain rights to use Third Party intellectual property rights for any Collaboration Assay(s), the parties similarly agree to negotiate in good faith an allocation of costs for such licenses, including payment of licensing fees, royalties or other payments that may be due to such Third Party, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. 8.6 Data and Results.

Title: Head of Oncology 26\",\n          \"Exhibit 28(h)(9) RESTATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT SECURIAN FUNDS TRUST RESTATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT, effective as of May 1, 2012, by and between Advantus Capital Management, Inc. (the \\\"Investment Adviser\\\"), Securian Financial Services, Inc. (the \\\"Underwriter\\\") and Securian Funds Trust (the \\\"Trust\\\"), a Delaware statutory trust, on behalf of the Trust's Advantus Money Market Fund (the \\\"Fund\\\"). WHEREAS, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization approved by both the Board of Trustees of the Trust and the Board of Directors of Advantus Series Fund, Inc. (the \\\"Series Fund\\\") on July 28, 2011, and approved by a majority of the shareholders of each Portfolio of the Series Fund on October 21, 2011, each Portfolio of the Series Fund was reorganized into a separate Fund of the Trust effective as of May 1, 2012; and WHEREAS, the Investment Adviser, the Underwriter and the Series Fund have previously entered into a Net Investment Income Maintenance Agreement, effective as of February 1, 2009 and an Amended and Restated Net Investment Income Maintenance Agreement effective as of October 29, 2009 (the \\\"Prior Agreements\\\"); and WHEREAS, the parties have determined that each desires to restate and adopt the Prior Agreements as set forth herein; and WHEREAS, the Trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \\\"1940 Act\\\"), as an open-end management company of the series type, and the Fund is a series of the Trust; and WHEREAS, the Trust and the Investment Adviser have entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement dated May 1, 2012 (the \\\"Advisory Agreement\\\"), pursuant to which the Investment Adviser will render investment advisory services to the Fund for compensation based on the value of the average daily net assets of the Fund; and WHEREAS, the Trust and the Underwriter have entered into an Underwriting and Distribution Agreement dated May 1, 2012 (the \\\"Underwriting Agreement\\\") pursuant to which the Underwriter acts the principal underwriter for the Fund, and receives compensation thereunder pursuant to the Fund's Rule 12b-1 Plan; and WHEREAS, the Trust and the Investment Adviser have determined that it is appropriate and in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders to maintain the Fund's daily \\\"Net Investment Income\\\" (as defined in paragraph 1.1 below) at or in excess of zero. NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows: 2 1. Net Investment Income Maintenance. 1.1 Net Investment Income. \\\"Fund Investment Income\\\", as defined in paragraph 1.2 below, minus \\\"Fund Operating Expenses\\\" as defined in paragraph 1.3 below equals Net Investment Income. If the Fund's Net Investment Income on any day is below zero, the Investment Adviser shall waive its Advisory Fee or reimburse the Fund an amount (defined as \\\"Expense Waiver\\\") sufficient to produce a Net Investment Income of zero. 1.2 Fund Investment Income. Fund Investment Income includes interest and dividends, net of foreign withholding taxes, plus income from securities lending activities, if applicable. Fund Investment Income does not include realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments and foreign currencies. 1.3 Fund Operating Expenses. Fund Operating Expenses are the aggregate expenses of every character incurred by the Fund, including but not limited to investment advisory fees of the Investment Adviser (but excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions and other expenditures which are capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the Fund's business). Fund Operating Expenses do not include \\\"acquired fund fees and expenses\\\" as defined in SEC Form N-1A, as it may be amended from time to time. 1.4 Method of Computing Expense Waiver. To determine the Expense Waiver (Investment Adviser's liability), each day the Fund Operating Expenses shall be subtracted from the Fund Investment Income to produce the daily Net Investment Income. If the daily Net Investment Income is below zero for any day, the Investment Adviser shall first waive or reduce its advisory fee for such day by an amount sufficient to bring the Net Investment Income to zero. If the amount of the waived or reduced advisory fee for any such day is insufficient to bring the Net Investment Income to zero , the Investment Adviser shall also pay Fund expenses or reimburse the Fund an amount that, together with the waived or reduced advisory fee, is sufficient to bring the Net Investment Income to zero. 1.5 Right of Recovery. The Investment Adviser shall have the option to recover the full amount waived, paid or reimbursed (the Expense Waiver) by the Investment Adviser on any day on which the Fund's Net Investment Income exceeds zero. In no event, however, shall the Expense Waiver, or any portion thereof, constitute an obligation of the Fund to the Investment Adviser on any such day unless the Investment Adviser has expressly exercised its right to recover all or a portion of the Expense Waiver on that day, in which case such portion of the Expense Waiver elected by the Investment Adviser for recovery that day shall then be due and payable. If, and to the extent, the payment by the Fund to the Investment Adviser of the Expense Waiver would cause the Fund's Net Investment Income to fall below zero, such payment shall be deferred until such date on which the In connection with the obligation of the Investment Adviser to maintain the Fund's Net Investment Income as set forth in section 1 herein, the Underwriter may waive its Rule 12b-1 fees contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement, and shall have the same rights to be reimbursed by the Fund as the Investment Adviser, as set forth in Section 1 herein, to the extent the Investment Adviser has not already been reimbursed by the Fund for its payment of Rule 12b-1 fees. This Agreement shall continue in effect for a period of one year from the date of its execution and from year to year thereafter provided such continuance is specifically approved by a majority of the trustees of the Trust who (i) are not \\\"interested persons\\\" of the Trust or any other party to this Agreement, as defined in the 1940 Act, and (ii) have no direct or indirect financial interest in the operation of this Agreement (\\\"Non- Interested Trustees\\\"). This Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the Advisory Agreement except the Investment Adviser's Right of Recovery set forth in section 1.5 herein. 3 payment would not cause the Fund to have a Net Investment Income of less than zero, provided that the right of the Investment Adviser to receive such payment shall expire three years after the day it effected such waiver, or made such payment or reimbursement. For purposes of this paragraph 1.5 (and for purposes of paragraph 2), the Expense Waiver that may be recovered from the Fund shall include the amount of any unrecovered Expense Waiver under the Prior Agreements, provided that the Investment Adviser's right to receive such payment shall also expire three years after the day it effected such waiver, or made such payment or reimbursement. 1.6 Payment. If the Investment Adviser is required to reimburse the Fund, the Investment Adviser shall make such payment within 30 days after each month-end in the amount due the Fund as of each month. If the Fund is required to pay the Investment Adviser the Expense Waiver, the Fund shall make such payment within 30 days after each month-end. Reimbursements to the Fund or the Expense Waiver shall not include any additional charges or fees whatsoever, including, e.g., interest accruable on such reimbursements or the Expense Waiver. 1.7 Operating Expense Limit. Any Expense Waiver recovery payment by the Fund to the Investment Adviser shall not cause the Operating Expense for the Fund's full year of operations to exceed 1.25% of the Fund's average daily net assets. 2. The Underwriter. 3. Term and Termination of Agreement. 4. Miscellaneous. 4.1 Captions. The captions in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and in no other way define or delineate any of the provisions hereof or otherwise affect their construction or effect. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed as of the day and year first above written. 4 4.2 Interpretation. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to require any party hereto to take any action contrary to its Articles of Incorporation or Agreement and Declaration of Trust or By-Laws, or any applicable statutory or regulatory (including self-regulatory) requirement to which it is subject or by which it is bound. 4.3 Definitions. Any question of interpretation of any term or provision of this Agreement, including, but not limited to the investment advisory or Rule 12b-1 fee, the computations of net asset values, and the allocation of expenses, having a counterpart in or otherwise derived from the terms and provisions of the Advisory Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement, or the 1940 Act, shall have the same meaning as and be resolved by reference to such Advisory Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement, or the 1940 Act.
